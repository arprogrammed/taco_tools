This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app.

## Taco Tools App

This app is a first run designed to showcase my abilities with Next.js, React, CSS, HTML, Javascript, API Routes, API integrations, passing Props and more! My skills in many of these areas are at a developmental support level.

## What Does It Do?

Right now it takes the edge user to a page for searching with their Wax Blockchain wallet address to obtain the amount of times they have "brigaded" or signed workopts with their wallet in the last 24hrs.

## What's Next?

As the Wax Blockchain universe expands I want to leverage more Historical Based API calls to design community tools with MongoDB and create sites for blockchain communities. This would allow them to have a "virtual homebase" build within an app that provides them leaderboard tools, lookups, and contest tools for incentives to further build the community.
